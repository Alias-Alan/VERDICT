## About

The VERDICT tool is intended to perform analysis of a system at the architectural level. The VERDICT user will capture an architectural model using AADL that represents the high-level functional components of the system along with the data flow between them. The VERDICT Model Based Architecture Analysis and Synthesis (MBAAS) back-end tool will analyze the architecture to identify cyber vulnerabilities and recommend defenses. Once the architectural analysis is complete, VERDICT supports refinement of the architecture model with behavioral modeling information using AGREE. The VERDICT Cyber Resiliency Verifier (CRV) back-end tool performs a formal analysis of the updated model with respect to formal cyber properties to identify vulnerabilities to cyber threat effects. This valuable capability provides an additional depth of analysis of a model that includes behavioral details of the architectural component models which will help to catch design mistakes earlier in the development process.
